This manual is not intended as a Software User's Guide. It is instead offered as
a guide to help the maintainer of the MOSES Flight Software to understand the
software at the source code level. However, this guide is also not meant to replace
the code as being the main source of information on the software. An in-depth understanding
of this software can only be achieved by scouring the source code. This might come as a
harsh reality to some, but this guide attempts to act as a road map for navigating around
this potentially intimidating reality.\\
\\
It should also be noted that this manual is bound to contain errors. Again, the source should
be used as the final arbiter of what is correct and what is incorrect.
