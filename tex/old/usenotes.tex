\\ 
Compiling this software should be as easy as using the Makefiles in the
respective directories. However, there are a number of libraries that must be
present in order to compile the software. These include libdscud5.a, pcifio\_api.a,
and libsensors.so. These libraries must also reside in the correct directories.
The Makefiles should be consulted to assist in placing these libraries in the correct
directories.\\
\\
After the moses\_install script is executed to ensure that all of the correct device files
and directories have been created, the software can be started, most likely at startup. It is important
to note that there is a sequence in which the programs should be started and tends to produce the 
best results. In order these go:\\
\\
/moses/bin/vtmudeck \& \\
/moses/bin/powerserver \& \\
/moses/bin/mdaq \& \\
/moses/bin/ioserver \& \\
\\
After this, communication with the system can be achieved through the IOServer.
